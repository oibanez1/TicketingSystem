# TicketingSystem
This project uses an MVC design pattern and is a ticketing system where an authenticated/authorized user will be able to create, delete, and update tickets to keep track of a given project. A user can consist of a guest, member, admin, or viewer. Each ticket will be either a 'task' or a 'bug' and will have different priority levels. 

Frontend - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Backend - python, flask, sqlalchemy, sqlite (Plan on using mysql near finish)
